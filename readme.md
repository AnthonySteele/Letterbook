# Letterbook

[![Build](https://github.com/Letterbook/Letterbook/actions/workflows/pull-request.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Letterbook/Letterbook/actions/workflows/pull-request.yml)

Letterbook is intended to be a mastodon-compatible federated microblogging server. The project has three primary goals:

1. Functional compatibility with Mastodon, and Mastodon clients
2. Reduced cost and complexity to deploy and operate
3. More robust moderation tools

## Contributing

This project is still in the very early stages, but we would love to have more contributors. This is a project built *for* the community, and it should also be built *by* the community. Unfortunately, things probably aren't established enough yet that someone could jump in without guidance. But, we would be happy to provide that guidance! Please reach out here on github, or on the fediverse.

The best way to get a sense of what's planned and in-progress is to look through these two project boards.

1. [Minimum Functionality](https://github.com/orgs/Letterbook/projects/1/views/2)
2. [Single User Preview](https://github.com/orgs/Letterbook/projects/5/views/2)

After that, please have a look at the [Contributing Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)
