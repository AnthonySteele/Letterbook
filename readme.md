# Letterbook

[![Build](https://github.com/Letterbook/Letterbook/actions/workflows/pull-request.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Letterbook/Letterbook/actions/workflows/pull-request.yml)

Letterbook is intended to be a mastodon-compatible federated microblogging server. The project has three primary goals:

1. Functional compatibility with Mastodon, and Mastodon clients
2. Reduced cost and complexity to deploy and operate
3. More robust moderation tools

## Background

Like a lot of other people, I joined the fediverse at the end of 2022. I had primarily used Twitter until then. There were always a lot of tradeoffs involved in that choice, but they ceased to be worthwhile. There are likewise tradeoffs in making my home on the fediverse. It's far from perfect. But of all the options, I believe the fediverse has the most upside, and by far the most future potential. That potential exists mainly in the more democratized nature of the network. Anyone can, *in theory*, run their own instance and set their own terms for engaging with the rest of the fediverse. Letterbook is an attempt to bring that theory closer to practice.

Like many people, I have concerns about the sustainability of the fediverse as it stands now.

* cost
* admin burnout
* coarse moderation
* "just move/just run your own"

## Contributing

This project is still in the very early stages, but we would love to have more contributors. This is a project built *for* the community, and it should also be built *by* the community. Unfortunately, things probably aren't established enough yet that someone could jump in without guidance. But, we would be happy to provide that guidance! Please reach out here on github, or on the fediverse.

The best way to get a sense of what's planned and in-progress is to look through these two project boards.

1. [Minimum Functionality](https://github.com/orgs/Letterbook/projects/1/views/2)
2. [Single User Preview](https://github.com/orgs/Letterbook/projects/5/views/2)

After that, please have a look at the [Contributing Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md)
